 - Normally, we are using register 0x5C to get number of buffers configured in the hardware
 and check if it is consistent with number of allocated buffers. However, in streaming mode
 this does not work at the moment. After writting the buffers, the hardware forgets them 
 and only stores the current queue of free buffers. Currently, the check is disabled in the
 streaming mode. Can we handle it somehow?
