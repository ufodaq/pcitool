High Priority (we would need it for IPE Camera)
=============
 1. Allow overriding of registers and banks (performance?).
 
Normal Priority (it would make just few things a bit easier)
===============
 1. Implement pcilib_configure_autotrigger
 2. Provide OR and AND operations on registers in cli
 3. Support writting a data from a binary file in cli
 
Low Priority (only as generalization for other projects)
============
 1. XML configurations describing registers (and DMA engines?)
 2. Access register/bank/lock lookups using hash tables
 3. Support for Network Registers and Network DMA
 4. Define a syntax for register dependencies / delays (?)
 5. Use pthread_condition_t instead of polling
 6. Support FIFO reads/writes from/to registers
 7. We managed kmem performance using next kmem prediction, but it is still wise to provide additionally a binary tree for faster search
