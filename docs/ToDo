High Priority (we would need it for IPE Camera)
=============
 1. Join multiple XML files and on error use simplified XSD scheme on all files to find the file causing error
 2. Information on bank and the view values in the pci -i <reg>, show listing of enum values (shall we have a type associated with the view: enum, range, ...?)
 
Normal Priority (it would make just few things a bit easier)
===============
 1. Implement pcilib_configure_autotrigger
 2. Provide OR and AND operations on registers in cli
 3. Support writting a data from a binary file in cli
 4. Support Python-scripts in a views, we need to provide python function to read registers/properties...

Low Priority (only as generalization for other projects)
============
 1. Shall we allow overriding of registers?
 2. Support for Network Registers and Network DMA
 3. Define a syntax for register dependencies / delays (?)
 4. Use pthread_condition_t instead of polling
 5. Support FIFO reads/writes from/to registers
 6. We managed kmem performance using next kmem prediction, but it is still wise to provide additionally a binary tree for faster search

Performance
===========
 1. Even with fully algined data, glibc defaults to __memcpy_sse2_unaligned (called from ipecamera_data_callback and fastwriter_push). Can we do something?
