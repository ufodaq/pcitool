High Priority (we would need it for IPE Camera)
=============
 1. Serialize access to the registers across applications
 2. Protect kmem_entries in the driver using spinlock
 3. Protect mmap operation (multiple kernel calls) with some locking mechanism 
 4. Allow overriding of registers and banks (performance?).
 
Normal Priority (it would make just few things a bit easier)
===============
 1. Implement software registers (stored in kernel-memory)
 2. Implement pcilib_configure_autotrigger
 3. Provide OR and AND operations on registers in cli
 4. Support writting a data from a binary file in cli
 
Low Priority (only as generalization for other projects)
============
 1. XML configurations describing registers (and DMA engines?)
 2. Access register/bank lookups using hash tables
 3. Support for Network Registers and Network DMA
 4. Define a syntax for register dependencies / delays (?)
 5. Use pthread_condition_t instead of polling
 6. Support FIFO reads/writes from/to registers
