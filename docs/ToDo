High Priority (we would need it for IPE Camera)
=============
 1. Join multiple XML files and on error use simplified XSD scheme on all files to find the file causing error
 
Normal Priority (it would make just few things a bit easier)
===============
 1. Implement pcilib_configure_autotrigger
 2. Provide OR and AND operations on registers in cli
 3. Support writting a data from a binary file in cli
 4. Support Python-scripts in a views, we need to provide python function to read registers/properties...
 5. Really check the specified min, max values while setting registers

Low Priority (only as generalization for other projects)
============
 1. Shall we allow overriding of registers?
 2. Support for Network Registers and Network DMA
 3. Define a syntax for register dependencies / delays (?)
 4. Use pthread_condition_t instead of polling
 5. Support FIFO reads/writes from/to registers
 6. We managed kmem performance using next kmem prediction, but it is still wise to provide additionally a binary tree for faster search

Performance
===========
 1. Even with fully algined data, glibc defaults to __memcpy_sse2_unaligned (called from ipecamera_data_callback and fastwriter_push). Can we do something?
